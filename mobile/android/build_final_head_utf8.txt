Dependency 'androidx.
appcompat:appcompat-r
esources:1.7.0' 
requires libraries 
and applications that
           depend on 
it to compile 
against version 34 
or later of the
           Android 
APIs.
     
           :app is 
currently compiled 
against android-33.
     
           Also, the 
maximum recommended 
compile SDK version 
for Android Gradle
           plugin 
7.4.2 is 33.
     
           
Recommended action: 
Update this 
project's version of 
the Android Gradle
           plugin to 
one that supports 
34, then update this 
project to use
           
compileSdkVerion of 
at least 34.
     
           Note that 
updating a library 
or application's 
compileSdkVersion 
(which
           allows 
newer APIs to be 
used) can be done 
separately from 
updating
           
targetSdkVersion 
(which opts the app 
in to new runtime 
behavior) and
